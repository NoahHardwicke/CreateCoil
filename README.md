# CreateCoil

A Wolfram Language (Mathematica) paclet for creating simple, discrete coils using current-carrying loops, arcs, or ellipses to generate magnetic fields.

## Installation

### Mathematica 13.0 or Later

To install the paclet in Mathematica 13.0 or later, simply evaluate:
```
PacletInstall["NoahH/CreateCoil"]
```
Once installed, the paclet can be loaded by evaluating:
```
Needs["NoahH`CreateCoil`"]
```

### Mathematica 12.3 or Earlier

Compatibility is not guaranteed for earlier versions of Mathematica, but you may install the paclet by downloading Resources/CreateCoil.paclet, and running `PacletInstall` on the file.
