# CreateCoil

A Wolfram Language (Mathematica) package for creating simple, discrete coils using current-carrying loops, saddles, or ellipses to generate magnetic fields.

### [View CreateCoil and its documentation on the Wolfram Paclet site](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PacletRepository/resources/NoahH/CreateCoil/)

## Installation

### Mathematica 13.0 or Later

To install the paclet in Mathematica 13.0 or later, simply evaluate (requires internet connection):
```
PacletInstall["NoahH/CreateCoil"]
```
Once installed, the paclet can be loaded by evaluating:
```
Needs["NoahH`CreateCoil`"]
```

### Mathematica 12.3 or Earlier

Compatibility is not guaranteed for earlier versions of Mathematica, but you may download [Kernel/CreateCoil.wl](Kernel/CreateCoil.wl) and run `Get` on the file to load the package.
