# CreateCoil
Create simple, discrete coils using current-carrying loops, arcs, or ellipses to generate magnetic fields

## Information
- Mathematica implementation.
- This package is currently in beta. Coil and field plotting functions, and documentation of all functions and options to follow.
- Ultimately, this package will be deployed through the Wolfram Paclet Repository. For now, run CodeBase/CreateCoilDiscrete.wl to load the package into a Mathematica kernel session (or call `Get` on the file).
